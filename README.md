This is a basic tool for IMMORTAL: Gates of Pyre to generate an Input.ini file (don't forget to name it that way)

It contains a default config found on the discord server in the dedicated channel for hotkeys
You can import your own config file for modification
The "Reset" Button will reset the current selected hotkey to its default value
The "Default" Button will default reset all hotkeys

THe "Â²" for French is unsupported via this tools, but file can still be manually edited afterward.

Modifier bShift, bCtrl, bAlt, bCmd are modifier used for key combination like => CTRL + X, Shit + 1, etc.. If you want to have a hotkey linked to Ctrl, you want to uncheck the box, and select the key in the dropdown list

Feel free to contact me on discord for any further question: alysaar_ (Kawa on the discord server)

Note: I tried my best to ease the life of everyone but please understand only hotkeys displayed in the dropdown list are currently accepted (based on file provided on the discord server). If you updated any hotkey to a "non convetionnal" one such as the previously noted hotkey, the Action mapping will DISAPPEAR upon save and have to be manually readded
Note2: This is actually my really first C# / WPF program ever made, please be gentle with me as code in disgusting to me and should not be considered as a pro level one. I am not sure if I will update the quality of the code overall unless strictly necessary as the tool is a temporary one before they implements key remapping within the game
